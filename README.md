# DNA-Sequence-Alignment

This program focuses on optimally aligning two strings. In order to accomplish this, I used the Needleman-Wunsch method with a vector of vectors of integers. It consists of filling out a table based on the edit distance between each character of the two strings we are comparing. I filled out the table from the bottom right corner. Then I aligned the strings by finding the optimal path on the table. To do so I had to check the right element in respect to the current element, then to the bottom element and then to the diagonal element in the table. If the path went down or right, I matched the char with a gap (denoted by 2), while if it went diagonally, I matched the char with the next corresponding char (denoted by a 0) otherwise it is represented by a 1.
